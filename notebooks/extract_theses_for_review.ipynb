      "0              1                     Generative AI's true impact is still in its early stages, with second order applications and AI-native business models continuing to emerge and evolve.                                                                            This thesis posits that the full potential of generative AI has yet to be realized, suggesting that as the technology matures, new applications and business models specifically designed around AI capabilities will continue to surface and develop.                       2  AI 20250923.pdf\n",

The argument here is that businesses that tailor AI solutions to specific industry needs, through strategies like Service Lifecycle Management (SLMs), Rights and Governance (RAG) pipelines, and dedicated AI agents, will create solutions that are not only highly effective but also difficult for competitors to replicate.

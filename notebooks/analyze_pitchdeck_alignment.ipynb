    "# Pitch Deck Alignment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes a pitch deck to determine how well it aligns with the thesis themes in the Neo4j graph database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Load pitch deck from `data/pitch_decks`\n",
    "2. Extract core takeaways and theses using GPT-4\n",
    "3. Query Neo4j for all thesis data\n",
    "4. Use GPT-4 to check alignment between pitch deck and all theses (batched in one call)\n",
    "5. Aggregate results by core thesis\n",
    "6. Generate comprehensive analysis using GPT-4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- Alignment scores (0-1) for each thesis\n",
    "- Evidence and strength of alignment\n",
    "- Core thesis alignment summary\n",
    "- GPT-4 analysis of overall fit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost:** ~$0.20-0.50 per analysis (much cheaper than individual calls)\n"

      "### Overall Alignment:\n",
      "\n",
      "The pitch deck from Cognaize demonstrates a strong alignment with our AI-focused thesis themes, achieving an average score of 0.443 in this category. This indicates a robust strategic fit, particularly in areas emphasizing hybrid AI, verticalized approaches, and AI business models. However, there's a notable lack of alignment with Biotech and Construction Tech themes, which is understandable given the company's focus on financial services and insurance sectors. The overall alignment suggests that Cognaize's pitch deck is well-tailored to our investment interests in AI but lacks relevance to our broader thematic interests in Biotech and Construction Tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Hybrid AI and Human-Centered AI**: The pitch deck's emphasis on hybrid intelligence for unstructured data processing aligns perfectly with our thesis on the necessity of enterprise strategy around hybrid AI, scoring a strong 1.000. This indicates a deep understanding and application of AI in a way that enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Verticalized Approach**: Focusing on financial services and insurance sectors demonstrates a strategic verticalized approach, aligning well with our thesis that specialized solutions in specific industries can drive significant value, scoring 0.800.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **AI Business Models**: The AI as a Service (AIaaS) model, coupled with demonstrated capital efficiency and growth, aligns strongly (0.800) with our thesis around the risks and rewards of AI business models, suggesting Cognaize has a sustainable and scalable approach to delivering AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Gaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Emerging AI Technologies**: The pitch deck does not address emerging areas of AI, such as generative AI, which is a missed opportunity given the growing importance of these technologies in driving innovation across sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Infrastructure Demands**: There's a weak alignment (0.500) on reshaping compute infrastructure demand, indicating a gap in addressing how their AI solutions impact or require changes in computational infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Non-AI Theses**: The complete lack of alignment with Biotech and Construction Tech themes indicates a narrow focus. While this focus is not inherently negative, it does suggest potential missed opportunities for cross-sector innovation or application of their technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Broaden AI Technology Scope**: Incorporating or at least acknowledging emerging AI technologies like generative AI could enhance the pitch deck's appeal and demonstrate forward-thinking. This could also potentially open up new use cases or markets for Cognaize.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Address Infrastructure Needs**: Expanding on how Cognaize's solutions interact with or necessitate changes in computational infrastructure could strengthen the pitch deck by addressing the weak alignment in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Explore Cross-Sector Applications**: While maintaining a focus on financial services and insurance, exploring potential applications or implications of their technology in other sectors (even if not immediately actionable) could present a more comprehensive vision and align with a broader range of our investment theses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Emphasize AIaaS Model Benefits**: Given the strong alignment and potential for scalability, further emphasizing the benefits and differentiators of their AIaaS model could make the pitch even more compelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategic Fit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognaize's pitch deck represents a good strategic fit with our AI-focused investment thesis framework, particularly in areas related to hybrid AI, verticalized approaches, and AI business models. However, to maximize alignment and appeal to a broader range of our investment interests, Cognaize could benefit from addressing the identified gaps, especially around emerging AI technologies and computational infrastructure demands. Their strong foundation in AI and machine learning, combined with a clear focus and demonstrated growth, positions them well within our investment framework, albeit with room for broader thematic engagement.\n"
